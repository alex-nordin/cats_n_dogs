Julia is an exciting language, particularly for machine learning, but some things are a bit more
complicated than the more established Python ML frameworks. This repo contains an effort on my part to
learn, therefore, how to perform transfer loading and loading and pre-processing datasets like the ones 
form Kaggle.

I drew heavily from the helpful Julia & Flux community such as the examples on [Flux model-zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo)
